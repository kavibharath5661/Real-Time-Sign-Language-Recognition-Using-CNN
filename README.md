# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-CNN
This project recognizes hand signs in real time using a webcam and deep learning, converting gestures into readable text to help reduce the communication gap for hearing-impaired people. It uses Python with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow to detect hands, extract features, and classify gestures accurately.
